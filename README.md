# MyIdeas
List of ideas (hoping one day I might make it big)

# NOTICE
Please feel free to use my ideas/presentation and implement them (give credits if possible; though I would be happy if someone implements them in my lifetime).   
Do feel free to reach out to me incase you are working on any of these ideas (I have put lot of thoughts on corner cases and other areas which might be useful to you).
